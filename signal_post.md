**The intersection of digital preservation and audiovisual archiving has reached a tipping point.** From the rapid improvements in digital capture technology, to storage that has increased in capacity and decreased in price, to the widespread use of cloud-based storage solutions, to the adoption of file-based production workflows and digital distribution technology, over the past decade we have witnessed a series of transformations that fundamentally alter dominant theories and practices of moving image preservation and access. But as the media production and use landscape evolves, so too have preservation strategies. 

To address the shifting terrain, we spent 1 month creating a collaborative proposal for a stream of sessions at the annual [Association of Moving Image Archivists](http://amianet.org/) (AMIA) conference. Although there have been talks at past AMIA conferences that have addressed aspects of digital preservation, the recent transition to a stream-based programming model provided us with a unique and valuable opportunity to discuss this topic in greater depth and length. The stream we proposed focuses on questions, challenges, and benefits related to the intersection of audiovisual content and digital preservation. We asked individuals from many communities to propose sessions, sign a letter of support (nearly 180 signatures from organizations across 5 different continents at the time of writing), and add topics that would benefit the A/V community. Our initial proposal included:
- Digital preservation in practice (_strategies_)
- How to preserve: sharing, learning, and building collaboratively (_innovation and practical engagement_)
- Dissolving boundaries: the necessity of multi-disciplinary input for preservation (_borrow and steal from people smarter than us_)
- Transitioning from a short-term digital preservation project to a long-term program (_sustainability_)

Submissions for additional sessions and talk proposals began to come in as soon as we opened the document for public comment and contributions. We received contributions from A/V archivists, digital asset managers, conservation and preservation specialists, and  academics from across library, archive, museum, gallery, government, and broadcast industries. Our initial list of topics ballooned to 10+ session proposals during the two-week period the document was open. As we expected, contributors addressed conceptual and practical conversations -- everything from workflows to ISO standards.

The wholesale acceptance of digital preservation has been slower within the moving image archiving and preservation community than in adjacent fields; for us, the broad-based support that our stream proposal received has been a clear indicator of both a pressing need and collective desire to address some of the practical, theoretical, and ontological questions that digital preservation raises for some of our colleagues. What we’re hoping to achieve with this proposed stream is--at least in part--to demonstrate that although audiovisual and other complex materials (e.g. software) may require special attention, the basics are already well understood and championed by other communities where expertise in this area is profound: Data storage research, all forms of computer sciences, information and knowledge management, emulation and migration specialists, and research repositories have a deep history in long-term data preservation. We can also learn from efforts in adjacent fields, like financial data security, and tweak the lessons learned to our needs and resources. The engagement of the analog film and video world, coupled with some of the benefits of digital persistence, serves all communities who embrace and contribute to it.

Integrating digital preservation activities into A/V preservation and increasing digital literacy across the field is integral to the field’s continued success and relevance. There have been some important gains in this area in recent years, including:
- [AMIA/DLF co-sponsored Hack Days] (http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2015)
- AMIA [Open Source Committee](https://github.com/amiaopensource) and the The Open Source Digital Preservation and Access Stream from the [2014 AMIA conference](http://www.amiaconference.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Program-Final-Web2.pdf). 
- Lightweight introduction panels to digital preservation concepts and software in [previous AMIA conferences](http://amianet.org/events/past-conferences) and programming alternatives dedicated to digital asset management
- The voluntary engagement of individual AV professionals in professional organizations and training that focus on digital preservation

By proposing a stream that is dedicated to the intersection of digital preservation and audiovisual archiving, we’re hoping to **break down any the barriers to knowledge** that may still exist so that digital preservation may be widely understood as a **core competency** in the A/V archiving field, rather than as a topic that gets pushed to the perimeter. 

With this base knowledge, the audiovisual archiving community can be part of a wider conversation and enjoy the benefits of collaborative progress. Our community-based solicitation approach (via GoogleDocs) mirrors need the need more voices in digital preservation conversation (across fields, communities, specialties -- no more operation in silos!). By providing alternate entry into a dedicated discussion of digital preservation, we welcome organizations and individuals who have limited resources or haven’t started strategically thinking about digital preservation -- and feel out-of-place or unwelcome in "specialized" discussions spaces like [NDSA](http://ndsa.diglib.org/) regional/national meetings, [iPRES](http://ipres-conference.org/), [PASIG](http://www.preservationandarchivingsig.org/), [DPC](http://www.dpconline.org/) etc. We want to bring digital preservation discussion into a comfortable space for AV folks -- somewhere like AMIA -- where the community can dip its toes in without feeling lost in a wave of information. In the next month alone, there are many opportunities (for example, the listings on the [DLF's Community Calendar](http://digital-conferences-calendar.info)) where A/V professionals can participate to share expertise in broader conversations.

We are excited to see the intersection of audiovisual content and digital preservation grow in visibility and expertise.
