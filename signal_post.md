**The intersection of digital preservation and audiovisual archiving is at a tipping point.** From the rapid improvements in digital capture technology, to storage that has increased in capacity and decreased in price, to the widespread use of cloud-based storage solutions, to the adoption of file-based production workflows and digital distribution technology, we are witnessing a series of transformations that fundamentally alter theories and practices of moving image management and access. But as the media production and use landscape evolves, so too have preservation strategies. 

So, we spent 1 month creating a collaborative proposal for a stream of sessions at the annual [Association of Moving Image Archivists](http://amianet.org/) (AMIA) conference. The stream focuses on questions, challenges, and benefits related to this subject. We asked individuals from many communities to propose sessions, sign a letter of support (totaling 175+ signatures at the time of writing), and add topics that would benefit the A/V community. Our initial proposal included:
- Digital preservation in practice (_strategies_)
- How to preserve: sharing, learning, and building collaboratively (_innovation and practical engagement_)
- Dissolving boundaries: the necessity of multi-disciplinary input for preservation (_borrow and steal from people smarter than us_)
- Transitioning from a short-term digital preservation project to a long-term program (_sustainability_)

This list ballooned to 15 ideas shortly after the document opened. Submissions came from from A/V archivists, digital asset managers, conservation and preservation specialists, and many more professionals from library, archive, museum, gallery, government, and broadcast industries. We received 10+ session proposals during the two-week period the document was open for public comment and contributions. As we expected, contributors addressed conceptual and practical conversations -- everything from workflows to ISO standards.

The acceptance of digital preservation as a valid and accessible option is a hurdle for the audiovisual archiving community; it has been perceived as a fringe or experimental approach in the past instead of a natural part of the governance lifecycle. Previous AMIA conferences generally paid minimal attention to the topic, as evident by the limited programming addressing these issues. The resistance stems from a fear of the unknown or the assumption that audiovisual materials are the exception to all rules. Audiovisual and other complex materials (e.g. software) may require special attention, but the basics are already well understood and championed by other communities where expertise in this area is profound. Data storage research, all forms of computer sciences, information and knowledge management, emulation and migration specialists, and research repositories have a deep history in long-term data preservation. We can also learn from efforts in adjacent fields, like financial data security, and tweak the lessons learned to our needs and resources. The engagement of the analog film and video world, coupled with the infinite benefits of digital persistence, serves all communities who embrace and contribute to it.

There are successes in integrating digital preservation activities and concepts into A/V educational and professional development opportunities. The following activities demonstrate interest in increased digital literacy within audiovisual preservation:
- [AMIA/DLF co-sponsored Hack Days] (http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2015)
- AMIA [Open Source Committee](https://github.com/amiaopensource)
- Lightweight introduction panels to digital preservation concepts and software in [previous AMIA conferences](http://amianet.org/events/past-conferences) and programming alternatives dedicated to digital asset management
- The voluntary engagement of individual AV professionals in professional organizations and training that focus on digital preservation

We hope to achieve a simple thing: **break down the barrier to knowledge** so that digital preservation may be widely understood **as a core competency** in the A/V archiving field, rather than as a topic pushed to the perimeter, discussed only in specialized spaces or groups. 

With this base knowledge, the audiovisual archiving community can be part of a wider conversation and enjoy the benefits of collaborative progress. Our community-based solicitation approach (via GoogleDocs) mirrors need the need more voices in digital preservation conversation (across fields, communities, specialties -- no more operation in silos!). By providing alternate entry into discussion of digital preservation, we welcome organizations and individuals who have limited resources or havenâ€™t started strategically thinking about digital preservation -- and feel out-of-place or unwelcome in "specialized" discussions spaces like [NDSA](http://ndsa.diglib.org/) regional/national meetings, [iPRES](http://ipres-conference.org/), [PASIG](http://www.preservationandarchivingsig.org/), [DPC](http://www.dpconline.org/) etc. We want to bring digital preservation discussion into a comfortable space for AV folks -- somewhere like AMIA -- where the community can dip its toes in without feeling lost in a wave of information. In the next month alone, there are many opportunities (for example, the listings on the [DLF's Community Calendar](http://digital-conferences-calendar.info)) where A/V professionals can participate to share expertise in broader conversations.

We are excited to see the intersection of audiovisual content and digital preservation grow in visibility and expertise.
