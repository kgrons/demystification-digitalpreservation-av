The audiovisual archiving and preservation field has undergone a seismic shift in the past 15 years. From the rapid improvements in digital capture technology, to storage that has increased in capacity and decreased in price, to the widespread use of cloud-based storage solutions, to the adoption of file-based production workflows and digital distribution technology, we are witnessing a series of transformations that fundamentally alter theories and practices of moving image management and access. But as the media production and use landscape evolves, so too have preservation strategies. As 21st century audiovisual professionals, digital preservation is an opportunity that affects us all. **There is a tangible need to address the intersection of digital preservation and audiovisual archiving.**

So, we spent one month creating a collaborative proposal for a stream of sessions at the annual Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) conference. In its current state the proposed stream,  "Ones, Zeroes, and You: Audiovisual Content and Digital Preservation", focuses on the myriad questions, challenges, and benefits related to this subject. We pre-populated a public proposal document with 4 topic ranges and asked individuals from many communities to propose sessions, sign a letter of support (totaling at ### signatures at the time of writing this post), and add other things of interest that would be beneficial to the A/V community. Our suggested topics included:
- Digital preservation in practice (strategies)
- How to preserve: sharing, learning, and building collaboratively (innovation and practical engagement)
- Dissolving boundaries: the necessity of multi-disciplinary input for preservation (borrow and steal from people smarter than us)
- Transitioning from digital preservation project to program (sustainability)

This list ballooned to 15 high level entries from A/V archivists,  digital asset managers, conservation and preservation specialists, and many more professionals from library, archive, museum, gallery, government, and broadcast industries. We also received 10+ session proposals during the two-week period the document was open for public comment and contributions. 

WHY DID WE NEED TO DO THIS
+ the acceptance of digital as preservation and not like a “fringe experimental science approach” as it’s been perceived in the past. The enagement of the analog world, coupled with the infinite benefits of digital persistance, serves all communities who willingly embrace and contribute to it.
+ the understanding that audiovisual or other complex materials (eg software) may include additional considerations, but the basics are already well understood and have been championed by other communities where expertise in this area is profound (not limited to: storage research, all forms of computer sciences, information and knowledge management, emulation and migration specialists, etc). We can learn from the high-impact worlds of financial and military data security and persistence. 

WHAT KIND OF CHANGES IN CULTURE ARE WE HOPING TO SEE FROM THIS
Our hope is to achieve a very simple thing: break down the barrier to knowledge for approaching and understanding digital preservation core concepts so that it is something that is discussed at all events, and not only as a segreated topics whispered about in a specialized stream or workshop. 

With this base knowledge, the audiovisual archiving community can be part of a wider conversation and enjoy the benefits of collaborative progress. Our community-based solicitation approach (via GoogleDocs) mirrors need for more voices in digital preservation conversation (across fields, communities, specialities - no more operation in silos!). By providing alternate entry into discussion of digital preservation, we welcome organizations and individuals who have limited resources or haven’t started strategically thinking about digital preservation - and therefore feel out of place or potentially unwelcome in "specialized" discussions spaces like NDSA regional/national meetings, iPRES, etc.
